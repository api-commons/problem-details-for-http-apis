# Problem Details for HTTP APIs
This is a base for applying the Problem Details for HTTP APIs in your API. It was original developed by Bump.sh as part of their Train Travel API template, which we have also published as a base, but this base is meant to just showcase Problem Details for HTTP APIs all by itself, encouraging reuse across APIs.

- [Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) -  This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry machine-readable details of errors in a HTTP response to avoid the need to define new error response formats for HTTP APIs.
- [Train Travel API: A Modern OpenAPI PetStore Replacement](https://bump.sh/blog/modern-openapi-petstore-replacement) - Everyone working with OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) will have come across the PetStore at some point. It's a sample OpenAPI description for an imaginary Pet Store with an API, but the OpenAPI is old, and the API it describes is pretty far from best practices. We thought it was time for a refresh, so we're bringing you the Train Travel API, a new sample OpenAPI you can use for your tooling and testing.
